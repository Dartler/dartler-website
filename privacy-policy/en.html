        <h1 class="mb-6">Privacy Policy for Dartler Standalone</h1>

        <p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy describes how the Dartler Standalone app (the "App") handles information.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Name and Contact Information of the Controller</h2>
        <p>The controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other national data
            protection laws of the member states as well as other data protection regulations is:</p>
        <p><strong>Dartler Suite</strong></p>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:dartler.suite@gmail.com"
                class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">dartler.suite@gmail.com</a></p>

        <h2>2. What Data Does the App Collect?</h2>
        <p>The App <strong class="important">exclusively collects and stores the following data locally on your
                device</strong>:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>Player Information:</strong> Names of players you create.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Statistics:</strong> Data related to games you've played, associated with the created
                players.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Is This Data Stored and Used?</h2>
        <p>All the data mentioned above is stored <strong class="important">exclusively in a local database on your
                device</strong>. It is used to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>Manage your player profiles.</li>
            <li>Display your game statistics within the App.</li>
            <li>Allow you to import statistics from other apps and integrate them into your local database.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong class="important">Important:</strong> This data is <strong class="important">not</strong>
                transmitted to us or third parties, unless you use the optional Google Drive backup feature.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Control Over Your Data</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data at all times:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>You can view and delete players and their statistics within the App at any time.</li>
            <li>You can delete imported statistics at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Optional Google Drive Backup Feature</h2>
        <p>The App offers an <strong class="important">optional</strong> feature to back up your game statistics to your
            personal Google Drive account.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>If you use this feature:</strong>
                <ul class="list-circle ml-6 mt-2">
                    <li>The App will ask for your consent to sign in with your Google account.</li>
                    <li>It will use the Google Drive API to create a cloud backup of your local statistics.</li>
                    <li>This backup will be stored <strong class="important">exclusively in the dedicated "App Data
                            folder" of your personal Google Drive account</strong>, which only this App can access. It's
                        not directly visible to other apps or users.</li>
                    <li>You can use this backup at any time to restore your statistics in the App.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What data is backed up?</strong> Only the player information and game statistics mentioned in
                Section 1 are backed up.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy with Google Drive:</strong> The use of Google Drive is subject to Google's privacy
                policy. Please review Google's privacy policy for more information.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Choice:</strong> Using this feature is completely optional. If you choose not to use it,
                all your data will remain stored exclusively on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Firebase APIs, Cloud Functions, and App Check</h2>
        <p>The App uses Firebase services, including Cloud Functions and App Check, to enhance functionality and
            security:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Functions:</strong> These are used to securely process certain app-related tasks
                in the cloud. No personal data is transmitted unless explicitly required for the feature you use.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase App Check:</strong> This feature helps protect the App and its backend services from
                abuse by verifying that requests come from the legitimate App. App Check may collect device-related
                information to perform this verification.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Logging Function Access for Rate Limiting:</h3>
        <p>To ensure stability, availability, and protection against abuse of our Cloud Functions, we log the time of
            the last access. For this, we use the Firebase App ID (a pseudonymous identifier of your app installation,
            not directly linked to personal data). This data is used solely for rate limiting to control the number of
            function calls and ensure fair usage and system stability. Processing is based on our legitimate interest
            under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. No manual linking with individual user data occurs. Access times are stored only
            for the short, dynamic period necessary for effective rate limiting (e.g., minutes to hours), unless
            required for abuse tracking or by legal obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Privacy with Firebase:</strong> The use of Firebase services is subject to Google's privacy
            policy. Please review Google's privacy policy for more information.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will inform you of any significant changes by
            publishing the new Privacy Policy within the App and on the Google Play Store. We encourage you to review
            this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at <a
